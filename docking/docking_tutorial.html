<h1 id="protein-protein-docking-tutorial">Protein-Protein Docking
Tutorial</h1>
<p>Computational protein-protein docking is the process of predicting
the structure of a protein complex from the structures of each
independent component. These techniques can generally be divided into
global docking, where the binding interfaces are completely unknown, or
local docking, where a rough idea of where the two systems come into
contact are known.</p>
<p>This tutorial presents a cross-docking benchmark experiment. The
antibody CR6261 binds to multiple sub-types of influenza antigen
hemagglutinin (HA). It has been crystallized with both H1 and H5 HA
sub-types. In this tutorial the antibody from one crystal structure
(3GBN) will be docked to the antigen from the other crystal structure
(3GBM).</p>
<h2 id="initial-set-up">Initial set-up</h2>
<p>Hemagglutinin is normally a trimer, but for this tutorial we’ll be
docking it as a monomer. (The antibodies we’re working with bind only to
a single monomer.)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a new working directory, and download the 3GBN and 3GBM
structures as PDB format.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to <a href="https://rcsb.org" class="uri">https://rcsb.org</a>
and type ‘3gbn’ in the search bar.</li>
<li>Click on ‘Download Files’ on the right side of the page, then ‘PDB
Format’.</li>
<li>Save the PDB file in your working directory as
<code>3gbn.pdb</code>.<br />
(Note, the file may automatically download to your “Downloads” folder.
If so, move the file into your working directory.)</li>
<li>Repeat for 3gbm</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Open both structures in ChimeraX, and examine the chains for each
structures. For structure 3GBM we have two complexes in the same crystal
unit: ABHL and CDIM. The chains AB/CD represents the head domain and the
stalk domain of the hemagglutinin protein, and HL/IM the CR6261 heavy
and light chains. For structure 3GBN we have the single complex ABHL. In
the next step we will extract the chain of interest for this
cross-docking experiment: chains AB for 3GBM and chains HL for
3GBN.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="structure-pre-processing">Structure pre-processing</h2>
<p>We need to extract only the chains of interest from each structure.
With both structure open in ChimeraX:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From 3GBM we want chains A &amp; B, but only the protein residues
<ol type="1">
<li>Select the chains: <code>select #1/A,B &amp; protein</code> (assumes
3GBM is model #1)</li>
<li>Save the chains as 3gbm_AB.pdb<br />
(File-&gt;Save-&gt;File of Type-&gt;PDB-&gt;Save selected atoms
only)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>From 3GBN we want to save chains H &amp; L. But when you examine the
structure, notice how the H&amp;L chains contains incomplete portions of
the full-length antibody. For the purposes of docking, we only need the
Fv region (the well-formed domains).
<ol type="1">
<li>Visualize the C-terminal bit of chain H to remove:
<code>color #2/H:112-188 magenta</code> (assumes 3GBN is model #2)</li>
<li>Remove the same selection: <code>delete #2/H:112-188</code></li>
<li>Visualize the C-terminal bit of chain L to remove:
<code>color #2/L:106-195 magenta</code></li>
<li>Remove the same selection: <code>delete #2/L:106-195</code></li>
<li>Select the chains: <code>select #2/H,L</code></li>
<li>Save the file as 3gbn_HL.pdb<br />
(File-&gt;Save-&gt;File of Type-&gt;PDB-&gt;Save selected atoms
only)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Reopen the 3gbm_AB.pdb and 3gbn_HL.pdb structures in ChimeraX, making
sure the structures are what you expect them to be.</p>
<h2 id="refine-the-starting-structures">Refine the starting
structures</h2>
<p>Structure refinement is essential for any post-processing step in
Rosetta to remove clashes that might be present in the crystal
structure. Refinement can be performed at multiple levels: repack
(side-chains only), minimization (side-chains and backbone) or relax,
which involve multiple cycles of repack and minimization.</p>
<p>We will use the ROSIE relax application to relax the structures into
the Rosetta energy function. To keep the structure backbones close to
what was crystallized, we’ll be adding coordinates tethers
(restraints/constraints) to the backbone atoms.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to <a href="https://rosie.rosettacommons.org"
class="uri">https://rosie.rosettacommons.org</a> and click the Relax
application.</li>
<li>Log in with your Github account, if prompted.</li>
<li>Upload the 3gbn_HL.pdb structure on the submission page</li>
<li>Check the box labeled “tether backbone coordinates of the pdbs being
relaxed to the coordinates in the xtal native”. Don’t tether sidechain
atoms</li>
<li>Give the job a descriptive name (e.g. “Relax 3gbn_HL.pdb”) and press
“upload and queue job”</li>
<li>Theoretically, you should repeat the submission for the 3gbm_AB.pdb
structure, but as it’s larger, it takes much longer to relax. As such,
we’ve provided a pre-relaxed version of the structure for you to
use.</li>
</ol>
<p>The relax job will likely take some time (5-10 minutes) to make it to
the front of the queue and run. You can keep the post-submission browser
tab open to monitor the status, or go to <a
href="https://r2.graylab.jhu.edu/queue"
class="uri">https://r2.graylab.jhu.edu/queue</a> to check the state of
your jobs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the job completes, go to the results page and click the
download button next to “output/relaxed.pdb” to download the structure.
Save the file as 3gbn_HL_relaxed.pdb (or 3gbm_AB_relaxed.pdb) in your
working directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can also be useful to pre-generate backbone conformational
diversity prior to docking particularly when the partners are
crystallized separately. In this case, backbone tethers aren’t used, and
multiple relaxed outputs with diverse backbone structures are docked
with each other in separate docking runs. However, backbone
conformational diversity will not be explored in this tutorial due to
time limitations.</p>
<h2 id="protein-protein-docking-setup.">Protein-protein docking
setup.</h2>
<p>For Rosetta protein-protein docking, both partners need to be in the
same input PDB. It’s also ideal if the structures are roughly in their
docked conformation (local docking). We can use this information to
improve the efficiency of the docking process and the quality of the
final model.</p>
<p>For our docking protocol, we already know where the structures should
roughly be docked, as we have a co-crystal structure of the
partners.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open 3gbm.pdb as well as the 3gbm_AB_relaxed.pdb and
3gbn_HL_relaxed.pdb structures in ChimeraX.</p>
<p>The following assumes 3gbm.pdb is model #1; 3gbm_AB_relaxed.pdb is
model #2 and 3gbn_HL_relaxed.pdb is model #3</p></li>
<li><p>Align the H &amp; L chains of 3gbn_HL_relaxed.pdb to the H &amp;
L chains of 3gbn.pdb (via CA atoms)</p>
<pre><code> align #3/H,L@CA &amp; protein toAtoms #1/H,L@CA &amp; protein matchNumbering true</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Align the A &amp; B chains of 3gbm_AB_relaxed.pdb to the A &amp;
B chains of 3gbn.pdb</p>
<pre><code> align #2/A,B@CA &amp; protein toAtoms #1/A,B@CA &amp; protein matchNumbering true</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Save the re-aligned chains to a file
<code>combined.pdb</code></p>
<p>File-&gt;Save-&gt;File of Type-&gt;PDB-&gt;(Make sure only
3gbm_AB_relaxed.pdb and 3gbn_HL_relaxed.pdb are selected in the box –
use ctrl-click or shift-click to select both.)</p></li>
<li><p>Close/hide all open structures and open the combined.pdb file –
check to make sure it’s what you expect it to be, has the all the chains
in the expected relative orientation, and does not contain any extra
residues from 3gbn.pdb.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="docking">Docking</h2>
<p>We’ll be using the ROSIE Docking application. This application is
built for general protein-protein docking, but can be used for
protein-antibody docking.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to <a href="https://rosie.rosettacommons.org"
class="uri">https://rosie.rosettacommons.org</a> and click the Docking
application.</li>
<li>Click the “[documentation]” link to read the Docking <a
href="https://r2.graylab.jhu.edu/apps/documentation/docking">documentation</a>.</li>
<li>Upload the combined.pdb file to the “Combined PDB file” entry.</li>
<li>Uncheck “use ensemble docking”</li>
<li>Leave the reference model box blank</li>
<li>Set the docking partners field to “AB_HL” (dock chains H&amp;L as a
unit to chains A&amp;B)</li>
<li>Enter a descriptive job name and click the “Upload and queue job”
button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Protein-protein docking can take some time to run. You can work ahead
with the post-analysis with the example structure provided.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-docking-results.">Analysis of docking results.</h2>
<h3 id="interpreting-rosie-output">Interpreting ROSIE output</h3>
<p>The ROSIE output page presents the 10 top scoring structures by
particular score metrics. The default is to rank the structures by the
interface binding score (I_sc). This is Rosetta’s best guess as to the
binding energy (in arbitrary units), with more negative being better.
This can be changed to other metrics, but there generally isn’t a reason
to do so.</p>
<p>To help interpret the docking results, it also presents a
score-versus rmsd plot (where by default the rmsd is plotted to the
input structure). This “funnel plot” should ideally show the low-energy
structures as all being low rmsd. Due to the Rosetta energy function
being rough, it’s not a problem if a low rmsd structure is a higher
energy. So as you go from high energies to lower energies, the plot for
a successful run should make a “funnel” being broad at the top and
narrow at the bottom, pointing toward 0 Ang rmsd. A successful funnel
indicates that the Rosetta sampling method was able to successfully pick
out a preferred (hopefully native) structure. While the stochastic
nature of the Rosetta sampling algorithm means that not all output
structures find the bottom of the docking well, having a number of
structures which can pick it out consistently lends support to the idea
that the low energy structures are native-like.</p>
<p>The calculated rmsd depends on the reference structure used. If your
input structure isn’t representative of the native structure, then the
tip of the funnel may point to a higher rmsd value. Note, though, that
rmsd space is not even. There’s “more room” at higher rmsds, so while
two structures at 1 Ang rmsd are likely close to each other, two
structures both at 10 Ang may not be similar to each other. So to be
safe, if the funnel is pointing to a high rmsd structure, you often want
to replot with rmsds calculated with the low energy structure as a
reference. (However, if all the low energy structures are similar to
each other when examined in ChimeraX or the like, then it’s likely the
docking run is successful</p>
<h3 id="examining-residue-energy-contributions.">Examining residue
energy contributions.</h3>
<p>ROSIE can provide energy information for protein structures
(including protein-protein complexes), allowing a more detailed
residue-by-residue examination of the interface.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to <a href="https://rosie.rosettacommons.org"
class="uri">https://rosie.rosettacommons.org</a> and click the “Energy
Breakdown” application.</li>
<li>Upload the docked structure (if you’re working ahead, use the
files/results/r_0715.pdb structure provided.)</li>
<li>The default values of “ignore waters”, “ref2015” and not parameter
files should be used.</li>
<li>Enter a descriptive job name and click the “Upload and queue job”
button.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the job finishes, the main outputs will be
<code>per_residue_energies.tsv</code> and
<code>residue_energy_breakdown.tsv</code> scorefiles in the “outputs”
section. Download these files.</p>
<p>The files are in a tabular format, and list calculated Rosetta Energy
values for each residue (<code>per_residue_energies.tsv</code>) or for
residue pairs (<code>residue_energy_breakdown.tsv</code>). These files
can be opened with a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel, LibreOffice Calc,
Google Sheets). When importing, select the options to use spaces as
delimiters and to merge adjacent delimiters.</p>
<p>The files list all energies, including residue-internal energies and
intra-chain energies. For docking purposes, we’re mainly interested in
the inter-chain residue energies.i</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open <code>residue_energy_breakdown.tsv</code> with your spreadsheet
program of choice.</li>
<li>Residue pairs should be listed with the partner which comes earlier
in the PDB coming first. We can use that to select only those lines
which are between the two chains.
<ol type="1">
<li>Highlight and delete all the “onebody” terms at the top of the
sheet.</li>
<li>Scroll down to where the <code>pdbid1</code> listing switches from
one binding partner to the other (e.g. A/B to H/L, or vice versa).</li>
<li>Highlight all the lines after the switchover point and delete
them.</li>
<li>Sort by the <code>resid2</code> column.</li>
<li>Scroll down to where the <code>pdbid2</code> listing switches from
one binding partner to the other (e.g. A/B to H/L, or vice versa).</li>
<li>Highlight all the lines <em>before</em> the switchover point (except
the column label line) and delete them.</li>
<li>If successful, all the remaining lines should just be between
residues in one partner and the other.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Sort the remaining lines (ascending) by the <code>total</code>
column. More negative scores are better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Residue-residue pairs with a highly negative score are contributing
favorably to the protein-protein binding interface (at least according
to Rosetta). Residue pairs with a highly positive scores are potentially
harming the protein-protein interface.</p>
<p>For a detailed description of what each energy term means, please see
Alford et al. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00125"
class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00125</a> Briefly, here
are the meanings of the non-zero terms you’re likely to see with
<code>ref2015</code> scoring for residue-residue interactions between
chains:</p>
<ul>
<li>fa_atr - the attractive component of the Lennard Jones (van der
Waals) interaction</li>
<li>fa_rep - the repulsive component of the the Lennard Jones (van der
Waals) interaction</li>
<li>fa_elec - the Coulombic electrostatic interaction</li>
<li>fa_sol &amp; lk_ball_wtd- Implicit solvation burial terms (from
Lazaridis &amp; Karplus, with modifications).</li>
<li>hbond_sr_bb - “short range” (primarily alpha helical)
backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds.</li>
<li>hbond_lr_bb - “long range” (beta sheets &amp; loops)
backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds</li>
<li>hbond_bb_sc - sidechain-backbone hydrogen bonds</li>
<li>hbond_sc - sidechain-sidechain hydrogen bonds</li>
</ul>
<p>(Other terms are either residue-internal energies, or will otherwise
not show up for inter-chain residue-residue interactions.)</p>
<p>Take a moment to look at the residues pairs which are highly scored
(either negatively or positively):</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the scoring, what sort of interactions are contributing
to that score value?</li>
<li>Looking at the docked structure in ChimeraX and visualizing those
residues, does that interaction make sense?</li>
<li>Can you determine which interactions are sidechain-based and which
are backbone based?</li>
<li>Would this analysis be helpful in determining potential mutational
effect experiments?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this analysis is somewhat basic. There are other protocols
(e.g. the <a
href="https://docs.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/application_documentation/analysis/interface-analyzer">InterfaceAnalyzer</a>
) which are more dedicated to analyzing and quantifying protein-protein
interfaces. Additionally, there are protocols which more directly probe
possible mutational analysis experiments.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-docking-approaches.">Advanced docking approaches.</h2>
<p>The protocol that we used to dock the two structures is a general
protocol to do protein-protein docking, but other specialized protocols
exist.</p>
<h3 id="snugdock">SnugDock</h3>
<p>Snugdock (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000644"
class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000644</a>) is an
antibody-specific docking protocol. In addition to the rigid body
rotation and translation sampling, Snugdock optimizes the interchain
heavy/light chain orientation, which has been shown to be important for
antibody/antigen binding. Snugdock is available as a ROSIE server (<a
href="https://rosie.rosettacommons.org/snug_dock"
class="uri">https://rosie.rosettacommons.org/snug_dock</a>).</p>
<h3 id="alphafold-other-ml-structure-prediction-packages">AlphaFold
&amp; other ML structure prediction packages</h3>
<p>Most machine-learning based structure prediction programs these days
can be used to predict the structures of protein complexes. You simply
have to give them the multiple chains you want to predict as a
complex.</p>
<p>If you have time, try inputing the sequences of the A, B, H &amp; L
chains to a machine learning approach such as AlphaFold3 (<a
href="https://alphafoldserver.com"
class="uri">https://alphafoldserver.com</a>) or ColabFold (<a
href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb"
class="uri">https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb</a>).
(For ColabFold, enter the sequence of each chain with a colon between
it.)</p>
<p>Note that for protein-protein docking, in addition to the standard
quality metrics like pTM and pLDDT, the pAE (predicted aligned error)
metric is of particular importance. pAE measures the estimated error of
residue-pairwise structure. As such, it’s good to look at the
between-chain pAE values, as that’s the best estimate of how well the
chains are placed (docked) relative to each other. If the ML model was
able to successfully predict the monomer and thus the majority of a
residues neighbors, that residue might still have a reasonably decent
pLDDT value, despite not being in the proper orientation with respect to
the binding partner. The pAE value of that residue with respect to the
other residues in the chain should give a better sense of how accurately
that residue was docked.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that most machine learning structure prediction
packages still have difficulties with antibody/antigen complexes,
particularly ones which don’t have related complexes in the PDB. Extra
scrutiny of such complexes is warranted.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that ML complex predictions can be used as
input to classical physics based docking approaches, if you want to
further diversify and refine them.</p>
<h3 id="alphared">AlphaRed</h3>
<p>Alpha Red (<a

class="uri">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.28.551063v1</a>
is a method which builds on AlphaFold multimer prediction, and combines
it with a physics based replica exchange approach to further diversify
and refine the docked structures. It has been shown to successfully find
the native complex structures in cases where AlphaFold by itself does
not. In particular, in a benchmark of antibody/antigen complexes, it
improved the successful docking rate from 19% to 51%. AlphaRed is
available as a ROSIE server <a
